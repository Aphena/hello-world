# hello-world

Hi

Hi, I am Aphena, a 4th year student from Molecular Genetics. 

My project is about RNA-seq analysis of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Ogataea parapolymorpha in stress condition to find out if the response was homologous in two organisms, despite they differ in growth temperature. 

My priority for 2021: I expect to successfully complete my project and finish my honor degree in May and start my master degree in Genetics in human diseases in September. 

Curious factor: good at making dark cuisine
